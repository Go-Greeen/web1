<strong><U> THE CHRIST, THE CRUCIFIXTION, AND THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS </u></strong>
<p style="margin-top: 40px;">The most important question of the twenty-first century is: Why did Jesus Christ suffer so much?
But we will never see this importance if we fail to go beyond human cause.
The ultimate answer to the question, Who crucified Jesus? is: God did.
It is a staggering thought. Jesus was his son.
And the suffering was unsurpassed. But the whole message of the Bible leads to this conclusion.</p>
