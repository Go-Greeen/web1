  <strong><U> Risk Is Right - Better to Lose Your Life Than to Waste It </u></strong>
  <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
    <strong>Exploding the Myth of Safety</strong><br>
    Therefore risk is woven into the fabric of our finite lives. We can not avoid risk even if we want to. Ignorance and uncertainty about tomorrow is our native air. All of our plans for tomorrow'sactivities can be shattered by a thousand unknowns whether we stay at home under the covers or ride the freeways. One of my aims is to explode the myth of safety and to somehow deliver you from the enchantment of security. Because it;s a mirage. It doesn't exist. Every direction you turn there are unknowns and things beyond your control.<br>
    The tragic hypocrisy is that the enchantment of security lets us take risks every day for ourselves but paralyzes us from taking risks for others on the Calvary road of love. We are deluded and think that it may jeopardize a security that in fact does not even exist. The way I hope to explode the myth of safety and to disenchant you with the mirage of security is simply to go to the Bible and show that it is right to risk for the cause of Christ, and not to is to waste your life.
